        <h1>Who Stole the Tarts?</h1>

        <p>The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived,
            with a great crowd assembled about them — all sorts of little birds and beasts,
            as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them,
            in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him;
            and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,
            and a scroll of parchment in the other.
            In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it:
            they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them —
            \"I wish they\'d get the trial done,\" she thought,
            \"and hand round the refreshments!\" But there seemed to be no chance of this,
            so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time.</p>
        <p>Alice had never been in a court of justice before,
            but she had read about them in books,
            and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything
            there. \"That\'s the judge, she said to herself,
            \"because of his great wig.\"</p>
        <p>The judge, by the way, was the King;
            and as he wore his crown over the wig,
            (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,)
            he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming
            <br/>&#8230;</p>

        There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.
        <br/>Better a witty fool than a foolish wit.
        <br/>No legacy is so rich as honesty.
        <br/>If music be the food of love, play on!
        <br/>Listen to many, speak to a few.
        <br/>Hell is empty and all the devils are here.
        <br/>To be, or not to be, that is the question.
        <br/>The empty vessel makes the loudest sound.
        <br/>To do a great right do a little wrong.
        <br/>The lunatic, the lover, and the poet, are of imagination all compact.
        <br/>Brevity is the soul of wit.
        <br/>What\'s done can\'t be undone
        <br/>What is past is prologue.
        <br/>Talking isn\'t doing. It is a kind of good deed to say well; and yet words are not deeds.
        <br/>No, I will be the pattern of all patience; I will say nothing.
        <br/>Nothing can come of nothing.
        <br/>Having nothing, nothing can he lose.
        <br/>Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.
        <br/>Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
        <br/>There\'s many a man has more hair than wit.
        <br/>Men\'s vows are women\'s traitors!
        <br/><br/>&#169; William Shakespeare
